About Neevo
===========

Neevo is a very small, fully object-oriented database abstraction layer for PHP.
It's open-source and released under the terms and conditions of the MIT license.

Neevo simplifies your daily work with databases - you can use the same code across
various supported SQL database systems without noticing any differences.
Thanks to the use of PHP's object-oriented features, manipulating with databases
was never simpler then now with Neevo. Do not bother about SQL injection attacks,
Neevo handles this too.
