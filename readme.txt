Neevo - Tiny open-source database layer for PHP
===============================================


Introduction
------------

Neevo is a very small database abstraction layer for PHP. It simplifies your daily
work with databases - you can use the same code across various supported SQL database
systems without noticing any differences.


Features
--------

 - Easy and intuitive manipulation
 - Transaction support
 - Multiple database drivers (MySQL, MySQLi, SQLite 2/3 and PostgreSQL)
 - Column type detection
 - Conditional statements
 - Query debugging
 And much more...


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for Neevo is available online: http://neevo.smasty.net/documentation
For examples of using Neevo, refer to the 'examples' directory.


Minified version
----------------

'neevo.min.php' is a single-file version of whole Neevo. It's useful if you don't
want to make any changes to the library. It is exactly the same as the normal
version but combined to one file with all comments and whitespace removed.
