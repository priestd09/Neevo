About Neevo
===========

Neevo is a very small, fully object-oriented database abstraction layer for PHP.
It's open-source and released under the terms and conditions of the MIT license.

Neevo allows you to easily write SQL queries for different SQL drivers
in unified syntax with the use of Object-oriented PHP. Of course, Neevo automatically
escapes all code to avoid SQL Injection attacs, etc.

Neevo currently supports only one SQL driver - MySQL (through PHP extension 'mysql')
but more drivers are beiing prepared: PostgreSQL and SQLite. Neevo also offers
an Interface for other programmers, so new drivers can be easily added.

Features
========
 - SELECT queries (JOINs not supported)
 - INSERT queries
 - UPDATE queries
 - DELETE queries

 - Multiple drivers support *
 - Fetch results: &quot;one method to rule them all&quot; - only one intelligent method
                   for fetching data from database.
 - Affected rows
 - Retrieved rows
 - Seek
 - Table prefix support
 - Query execution time
 - Last executed query
 - Wxecuted queries counter
 - Query and connection info
 - Randomize result order
 - Dump queries
 - Multi-level error-reporting system (based on Exceptions):
    - E_NONE:    No errors and warnings are reported.
    - E_CATCH:   All errors and warnings are auto-catched (printed with &quot;echo&quot;).
    - E_WARNING: Warnings are catched, errros thrown only.
    - E_STRICT:  All errors and warnings are thrown only.


* Currently supported SQL drivers:
 - MySQL (PHP extension 'mysql')
