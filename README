About Neevo
===========

Neevo is a very small, fully object-oriented database abstraction layer for PHP.
It's open-source and released under the terms and conditions of the MIT license.

Neevo allows you to easily write SQL queries for different SQL drivers
in unified syntax with the use of Object-oriented PHP. Of course, Neevo automatically
escapes all code to avoid SQL Injection attacs, etc.

Neevo currently supports only one SQL driver - MySQL (through PHP extension 'mysql')
but more drivers are beiing prepared: PostgreSQL and SQLite. Neevo also offers
an Interface for other programmers, so new drivers can be easily added.
